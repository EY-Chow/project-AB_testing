The probability that an individual received the new page is 0.5001, which is nearly equivalent to the probability that an individual received the old page. (1-0.5001=0.4999).  However, the probability that an individual in the \"treatment\" group, which viewed the new page, converted is 0.1188, which is less than the probability that an individual in the \"control\" group, which viewed the old page, converted at 0.1204. In fact, the probability that an individual converted, regardless of the type of page, is 0.1196, which is the mean of 0.1188 and 0.1204."

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "We took multiple approaches to examine the conversion rate of the old page vs. the new page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our analyses, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the old page results in the same or more conversions as the new page. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, examining the dataset, the probability that an individual received the new page is 0.5001, which is nearly equivalent to the probability that an individual received the old page. (1-0.5001=0.4999). However, the probability that an individual in the \"treatment\" group, which viewed the new page, converted is 0.1188, which is less than the probability that an individual in the \"control\" group, which viewed the old page, converted at 0.1204. In fact, the probability that an individual converted, regardless of the type of page, is 0.1196, which is the mean of 0.1188 and 0.1204.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we created a simulation that drew 10,000 samples from a binomial distribution to compute the difference between new page conversions (p_new) and old page (p_old conversions and compare them with the actual difference between new page and old conversions to get the p-value, which is the probability the observed difference in conversion rate between p_new and p_old is the result of random occurances (in other words, if the null hypothesis is true). In our case, the p-value is approximately 0.905, which is greater than 0.05, which means that we fail to reject the null hypothesis. In other words, any difference in the conversion rate between the new and old pages is not statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we used stats.proportions_ztest to compute a Z-test statistic and p-value. The Z-test statistic was about -1.3 and the p-value was again 0.905.  The z-score and p-value indicate that the difference between conversion rates of the old and new pages are not statistically significant, and that they agree with the earlier findings. Once again, we would not reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we used statsmodels to conduct a logistic regression. We added an intercept column, as well as an ab_page column of dummy variables, which is 1 when an individual receives the treatment and 0 if control. The p-value for the observed differences between the new page and old page conversion rate is 0.19. But the logistic regression is a two-tailed test (unlike Part II, which was a one-tail test), so to convert the p-values between each other, divide 0.19 by 2 to look at one tail only: 0.19/2 = 0.095. We subtract this from one because one tail: 1-0.095 = 0.905. This is nearly identical to the p-value from the earlier analyses In any event, the p-value calculated in this section supports our previous analysis, which is that the p-value indicates that the difference between conversion rates of the old and new pages are not statistically significant, and once again, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then looked at whether country had an impact on conversion. We added data indicating the country the individual was from: Canada, UK or US, converted that data to dummy variables, and conducted a logistic regression. If an individual is in Canada, they are 0.96 times as to convert than in the US and 0.95 times as likely to convert than in the UK, holding all other variables constant. However, none of the country variables appear to be statistically significant since all p-values are over 0.05. Once again, it appears that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the old page results in an equal number or more conversions than the new page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there is no significant p-value even after the addition of country dependent conversion variables and therefore we fail to reject the null. None of the country dependent conversion variables appear to be statistically significant since all p-values are over 0.05. Yet again, it appears that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the old page results in an equal number or more conversions than the new page. \n",
    "\n",
    "There may be other factors to consider for future analysis, such as the amount of time spent viewing the new page/old page or the gender or age of the viewer, assuming such data is available. It is a good idea to consider other factors to add into the regression model because there may be additional factors that affect conversion rate that we have considered and that might actually result in rejecting the null hypothesis. But adding factors into the regressional model reduces the number of degrees of freedom, and we might not be able to find these additional effects on conversion rate as a result."
